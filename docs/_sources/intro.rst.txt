Introduction
============

Pathfinder is a innovative feature selection method based on the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm.

Pathfinder is in continuous developing and improving, so the actual version is composed of a filter approach and a randomized search heuristic.

There are 2 main classes in this method:
    
    - :py:mod:`featureselector`: refers to the main algorithm class and their functions.
    - :py:mod:`ant`: refers to the ant class.

Each class is documented in its corresponding section, the installation is detailed in :ref:`Installation` and the usage of the program is explained in the :ref:`Usage`.
